            <h5>Food for a family</h5>

            <p>People complain about the rich-and-poor divide. It's crazy, no doubt about it. But what gets me is that
                today, a billionaire or head of state on their smartphone has the same direct access to information as a
                homeless person has on a smartphone - or a person in Bangladesh or Papua New Guinea.</p>

        <div class="shelter">
            <h5>Shelter for a family</h5>

            <p>Since 1999, Habitat for Humanity Bangladesh has been working with low-income families to build strength,
                stability and self-reliance through shelter. Habitat Bangladesh currently operates in Dhaka, Chattogram,
                Mymensingh, Jamalpur, Khulna and Barishal districts. The programs include decent, affordable housing,
                clean
                water and safe sanitation, training in appropriate construction technology as well as disaster response
                and
                mitigation.

        <div class="education">
            <h5>Education for a child</h5>

            <p>PThe largest issue for the education system in Bangladesh is lack of quality. Overcrowding and
                under-qualified instructors have led to high dropout rates at the primary and secondary levels. In fact,
                while primary enrollment may be at 98%, it drops substantially to 22% at the higher secondary level.
                This is
                especially evident in rural communities where various social and economic factors can prevent safe
                access to
                education – things like natural disasters, child labor, family poverty, disability, gender abuse, child
                marriage, and poor sanitation.
